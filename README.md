## Task
This project involves developing a Flutter application with Firebase as the database. The application manages workout records, allowing users to add, edit, delete, and display exercise data.

### Project Requirements:
- The Firebase project name should be set using only the student's English name.
- The database must contain a single collection named **Workout**.
- Users can add workout records to Firebase Firestore, including the **activity name, duration (in minutes), and calories burned**.
- The application should display a list of recorded workouts, showing **only the activity name and calories burned**.
- Workout records can be edited, but **only the activity name and duration (in minutes)** can be modified.
- Workout records can be deleted from the database.
